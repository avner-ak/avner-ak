However, there is little large-scale evidence on how efficiently firms use these technologies. In this paper, we study firm productivity and learning in cloud computing by leveraging CPU utilization data from over 1 billion virtual machines used by nearly 100,000 firms.  We find large and persistent heterogeneity in compute productivity, both across and within firms, similar to canonical results in the literature. More productive firms respond better to demand fluctuations, use a wider variety of specialized machines, and show higher attentiveness to resource utilization. Notably, productivity is dynamic as firms learn to be more productive over time. New cloud adopters improve their productivity by 40\\% in their first year and reach the productivity level of experienced firms within four years. Our counterfactual calculations suggest large aggregate implications of dispersion in compute productivity: raising all firms to the 80th percentile of productivity would reduce the consumption of compute resources and electricity by 20%.\n  \n\n\nAntitrust Spillovers: Evidence from Meatpacking, 1917–1921\n  \n            Abstract\n  \n  \n\n  \n    How does antitrust enforcement in product markets affect outcomes in input markets? I explore this question theoretically and empirically in the context of the U.S. meatpacking industry in the early 20th century. I exploit a 1920 consent decree designed to prevent meatpacking firms from colluding in livestock (input) and product markets, but which did not directly affect the labor market. I use novel occupation-level wage and employment data to characterize how this change in product and input market conduct affected wages of meatpacking employees, and how the effect differed across different types of workers. I find that after the consent decree, average meatpacking wages increased by 3.7% relative to the wages of other occupations in the same city, while the wages of unskilled employees increased by more than the wages of skilled employees. Using a model of labor market competition under different kinds of product market conduct, I establish two potential mechanisms: that meatpackers held more market power over skilled workers, and that the marginal product of skilled workers was more decreasing. The results highlight that welfare analyses of antitrust enforcement should account for spillovers into markets besides the one directly targeted."
