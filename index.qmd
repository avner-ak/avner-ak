I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in economics at Northwestern University (degree expected in 2027). I do research in empirical and theoretical industrial organization, primarily on topics related to antitrust and competition policy.

I previously worked in economic consulting at Cornerstone Research. Prior to that, I did my undergrad at Stanford, graduating in 2018.
