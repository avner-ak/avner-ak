I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in economics at Northwestern University (degree expected in 2027). I do research in empirical and theoretical industrial organization, primarily on topics related to antitrust and competition policy.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked in economic consulting at Cornerstone Research. I graduated from Stanford in 2018 with a BA in economics and an MA in public policy.
